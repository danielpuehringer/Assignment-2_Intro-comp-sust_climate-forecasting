## Side note: How did we get the data?
1. Data collection
 - Downloaded the data (link from assignment document), reading relevant info
 - Randomly generate dataset with 100 locations using ```random-data-selection.py```
2. Run ```preprocessing.ipynb``` to generate the required file ```preprocessed_data.pkl```
3. Run the other ML files
 - Ridge Regression
 - Feed Forward NN
 - RNN LSTM
 - WaveNet
